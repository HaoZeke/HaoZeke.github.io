* About
- This is a standard landing page and blog for my miscellaneous thoughts and essentially links out to all my other work.
- The theme is based off this [[https://themes.gohugo.io//theme/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/][theme]]
- The rest of the site is configured to work well with doom-emacs, so it uses ~ox-hugo~
* Build
The ~node~ packages are to be generated with:
#+begin_src bash
node2nix -c node.nix
#+end_src
