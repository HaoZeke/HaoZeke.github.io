*Hi.*

I'm [[https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2393-8056][Rohit Goswami]], better known across the web as ~HaoZeke~. I'm not the
first of my name, which is why I mostly use ~rg0swami~ when I need to be
identified by something closer to my name.

** Why this site exists
I have a lot of online presences. I have been around (or at-least, lurking) for
over ten years. Almost as long as I have been programming. Anyway, I have a
penchant lately for using ~emacs~ and honestly there isn't very good support for
~org-mode~ files. There are options recently with ~gatsby~ as well, but this
seemed kinda neat.
** What 'this' is
- This site is [[http://gohugo.io/][built by Hugo]]
- The posts are [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][generated with ox-hugo]]
- The theme is based of this [[https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng][excellent one]] and my modifications [[https://github.com/HaoZeke/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng-hz][are here]]
** What is here
- Mostly random thoughts I don't mind people knowing
- Some tech stuff which isn't coherent enough to be put in any form with
  references
- Emacs specific workflows which I might want to write about more than [[https://dotdoom.grimoire.science/][short
  notes on the config]]
** What isn't here
- More coherent thoughts will *not* be here, that should and will go to my [[https://grimoire.science][grimoire]]
- My [[https://dotdoom.grimoire.science/][doom-emacs configuration]]
- Academic stuff is better tracked on [[https://publons.com/researcher/2911170/rohit-goswami/][Publons]] or [[https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=36gIdJMAAAAJ&hl=en][Google Scholar]] or my pages
  hosted by my favorite [[https://femtolab.science/people/rohit][IITK group]] or [[https://www.hi.is/starfsfolk/rog32][UI group]]

** Background
As a member of several large organizations, I get a lot of github notifications.
Not all of these are of relevance to me. This is especially true of
~psuedo-monorepo~ style repositories like the [[https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews][JOSS review system]] and
*especially* the [[https://github.com/exercism/v3/][exercism community]].

- I recently (re-)joined the [[https://exercism.io/][exercism community]] as a maintainer for the C++
  lessons after having been a (sporadic) teacher
- This was largely in response to a community call to action as the group needed
  new blood to usher in *v3* of the exercism project

Anyway, I have since found that at the small cost of possibly much of my public
repo data, I can manage my notifications better with [[https://octobox.io/][Octobox]]

** Octobox
- It appears to be free for now
- It syncs on demand (useful)
- I can search things quite easily
- They have a neat logo
- There appear to be many features I probably won't use

It looks like this:
